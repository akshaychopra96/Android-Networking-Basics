# Android-Networking-Basics

Hi Friends!

### WHO IS THIS REPO FOR?

If you are a Android Developer and have read about Networking in Android, but wanna practice and understand these 
Networking concepts,then this GitHub Repo is for you.

### WHAT ALL ANDROID CONCEPTS IT COVERS?

- JSON Parser in Android
- ASyncTask (Working in Background Thread)
- ProgressDialog

### WHAT I HAVE DONE IN THIS PROJECT?

Its a simple App demonstrating how we can get some data from internet and show it in our app. To demonstrate this, I have used
the following API :  http://mobileappdatabase.in/demo/smartnews/app_dashboard/jsonUrl/single-article.php?article-id=71

The data we get from here is in JSON format. Thus, we have used JSON class in Android to read and get the specific values 
that we want to display. 

Also, I am showing an image (from url) in this app. Therefore, I have used an external library
named Glide: https://github.com/bumptech/glide to load and display the image from URL.

I have provided comments everywhere in the code to give you more details and help you in understanding the concepts.
